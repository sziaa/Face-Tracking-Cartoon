# Face-Tracking-Cartoon
Aang from Avatar: The Last Airbender has eyes that track your movements through your screen camera and when you come to close the image changes into an attack image.

Requirments:

- Python 3.5 or above
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Pygames

Clone the repository and run Avatar Tracking Eyes. You can recreate this with a different character by finding your own images in the same format as the photos saved in required_images file. That is they are all png's, where one is just the eye balls, a photo of the character where the eyes are missing, and a third image of what happens when you come close.
