# Face-Tracking-Cartoon
This project aims to have the character Aang from Avatar: The Last Airbender's eyes track your movements through your screen camera and when you come too close, the image changes into an attack image. A demo video is provided below.

Requirments:

- Python 3.5 or above
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Pygames

Clone the repository and run avatar_face_tracking. You can recreate this with a different character by finding your own 3 images in the same format as the photos saved in called aang_happy, aang_eyes_exp, aang_attack_1. That is they are all png's, where one is just the eye balls, a photo of the character where the eyes are missing, and a third image of what happens when you come close.
